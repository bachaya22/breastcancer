# Cancer Prediction Web App  

A Flask-based web application that predicts whether a breast cancerous or not based on user-provided input. The prediction is powered by a pre-trained machine learning model using logistic regression.

## Features  
- Simple and intuitive web interface for predictions.  
- Accepts comma-separated numeric values as input.  
- Real-time prediction of "Cancerous" or "Not Cancerous".  

## Technologies Used  
- **Flask**: Backend web framework.  
- **Python**: Programming language for model integration.  
- **NumPy**: Data processing.  
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic regression model trained for cancer prediction.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-prediction-webapp.git  
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the Flask application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  
4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Input Format  
Provide the tumor features as a single line of comma-separated numeric values (e.g., `9.11157302e+08,2.11000000e+01,...`).
